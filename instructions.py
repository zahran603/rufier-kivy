This app helps us \n carry out an initial diagnosis of your health \n using the Ruffier test.
The Ruffier test is a stress test\n intended to evaluate the performance of the heart during physical exertion.\n
The user calculates their heart rate over 15 seconds.\n
Then the user does 30 squats over the course of 45 seconds.\n
After the end of the exertion, the heart rate is calculated again: \n the number of beats after the first 15 seconds, after 30 seconds of rest,\n and the number of beats over the last 15 seconds.\n'''
